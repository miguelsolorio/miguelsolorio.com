# Intro
Kustomer is a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) platform that offers a unified view of customer interactions and communication channels. Kustomer was acquired by Meta in 2022.

## My role

I joined Kustomer as the first design systems lead and had the pleasure of partnering with our front-end engineer who had already made great strides in maturing the design system. Our team grew to 2 designers and 2 engineers and I lead our weekly syncs, roadmap planning & tracking, and socializing our work.

# Design System Audit

Since I was the first design systems lead, the design system had been contributed by members of the design team over the years so in order to start cataloging our inventory I created a component audit and compared what we had in code vs our components in design (Figma).

After auditing over 120 components, it was clear that our Figma library was either out of date or missing components completely. To make matters worse, we had a fraction of our components documented so there was no general guidance or best practices for using our components.

# Influencing The Work
In order to get the work done, we needed buy-in from leadership to ensure we'd have full support to properly build the foundation right so we can scale for the future. With the partnership of engineering, we created our team's roadmap for the year and created an execution plan to ensure the proper scope for our projects.

Once we received sign off from leadership on our priorities, we began the work to bring our library up to pairty with what is used in code. Over the next 4 months we were able to exceed our expectation and meet our milestones for the year. We also began to socialize our work across the organization to show the value that design systems brought to our product.

I also began the process of documenting the changes through a changelog inside of the Figma design file, as well as with every update to ensure designers knew what components were being updated in each release. This increased awareness and visibility of design system component updates.

I also began documenting the various component requests we received from feature teams, as well as existing components that were being updated. This increased the visibility of design system components that were being updated and allowed product teams to track the status of components.

# Impact

Over the course of the next 6 months, I helped bring our Figma library up to pairity with what developers have been using and also snapped our terminology to the same vocabulary so designers and developers stayed in sync. We also worked to update all of our existing docuemntation to a single platform so that designers and developers were using the same guidelines.

After several sprints, we were able to make major strides in bringing our component to pairity:

- Updated components improved from 26% to 75%
- Outdated components decreased from 33% to 5%
- Missing components decreased from 41% to 17%

This allowed our design team to move more efficiently in creating new features without having to worry about if our components were out of date. Our designer to developer hand off transition significantly improved since everyone was using the same terminology and referencing the same components, reducing the issues at implementation.
